There are basically 3 files, index.html save.php and show.php
index.html is the source file which contains the frontend components of the app and uses languages like html, css taking help from bootstrap and jquery
scan.php contains the code to scan txt file and connect to the database and save total number of counts of all the words in the txt file.
show.php contains the code to search the database for n highest repeated words and pass them using json 


For front end i have used bootstrap with jquery in some places
For back end core php has been used
